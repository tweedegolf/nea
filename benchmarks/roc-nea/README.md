# roc + nea

Benchmarks the performance of a nea platform using a (statically linked) roc request handler.

## Running

The examples can be run with the roc compiler ([installation instructions](https://www.roc-lang.org/install)), but do require cargo to be installed. For performance benchmarking, it is essential to limit the number of log messages that is printed (the lock on stderr is very contested) by setting the `RUST_LOG=error` environment variable for the command.

```
# a debug build that prints many log messages 
roc send-static-file.roc

# only print error log messages; used for benchmarking
RUST_LOG=error roc --optimize send-static-file.roc
```

Even when only error messages are configured, some log messages may be visible. These are printed before `main` runs and configures the log level. On linux, this is the expected output:

```
> RUST_LOG=error roc send-static-file.roc

## Testing & Benchmarking

To just validate an endpoint, we can use curl 

```
> curl -i 127.0.0.1:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

[workspace]
members = [ 
    "log",
    "shared",
    "roc_app",
    "nea",
]
exclude = [
    "benchmarks",
]
resolver = "2"
```

For performance benchmarking the `siege` tool can be used


```
> siege -c 4 127.0.0.1:8080
** SIEGE 4.0.4
